# The Dawn of the Dark Ages - Python Console RPG

*Replace this placeholder image with an actual screenshot of your game running in the console!*

This project is a **purely console-based (text-driven) Role-Playing Game (RPG)** application developed entirely using Python. Players interact with the game through text commands and responses in the terminal, immersing themselves in an adventurous story, developing their character, and overcoming challenges within a dark fantasy setting.

## Features

The game's core mechanics and features include:

* **Character Creation:** Players create and define their character's initial statistics (e.g., Strength, Dexterity, Health) via console input.
* **Exploration & Story Progression:** Navigate through different regions and advance the game's captivating narrative through text-based choices and descriptions.
* **Dynamic Combat System:** Engage in a strategic, turn-based combat system displayed directly in the console, where player decisions and character abilities are key.
* **Inventory Management:** Players collect, use, and effectively manage various in-game items, weapons, and armor through text commands.
* **Market System:** Players can buy and sell items, weapons, and armor within the game's console interface to enhance their character or manage resources.

## Technologies Used

This application was developed using the following technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Key Libraries/Modules:**
    * `random` - For various randomization needs (e.g., combat outcomes, item drops).
    * `time` - For managing game timing and pauses (e.g., displaying text gradually).
